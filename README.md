# Linux support for the ASUS ProArt P16 RTX Spark

Kernel patches, driver setup and a reproducible installation guide for running
**Omarchy Linux ARM64 on the ASUS ProArt P16 H7607BA**, powered by the
**NVIDIA RTX Spark N1X** platform.

This repository supplies the machine-specific fixes needed to turn an Omarchy
ARM64 Nightly installation into the P16 setup used on the validated hardware.
It covers internal input, ACPI and battery reporting, ASUS controls, NVIDIA
graphics configuration, USB4 boot settings and power/temperature telemetry.
The guide below takes you from the Nightly installation through building,
installing and checking the patched kernel, with recovery instructions.

This setup builds on Josephine Pfeiffer's
[Arch Linux ARM ProArt P16 work (`pfeifferj/archlinuxarm-proart-p16`)](https://github.com/pfeifferj/archlinuxarm-proart-p16).
The ACPI implementation, ARM64 ACPI allocation fix, touchpad workaround and
speaker-firmware extraction metadata used here are described with their exact
origins and local adaptations in [Provenance and local additions](#provenance-and-local-additions).

## What this repository provides

| Area | Included support |
|---|---|
| Internal keyboard and touchpad | ACPI/SSPM enumeration fixes, early input modules and keyboard support at the encrypted-disk prompt |
| Touchpad pressure and speakers | Idempotent PixArt pressure quirk and checksum-verified ASUS/Cirrus speaker firmware extraction, included in installation backups |
| Kernel and firmware interfaces | A separately packaged P16 kernel, ARM64 ACPI override allocation fix, firmware-table transformations and SPI-HID fixes |
| ASUS controls | ARM64 WMI support, power-profile integration and a battery charge-limit service |
| NVIDIA graphics | NVIDIA open DKMS setup, early module loading, DRM modesetting/fbdev and a block on the conflicting legacy `nvidiafb` driver |
| USB4 and boot configuration | Explicit USB4 resource retention, PCI hotplug reservations, suspend-to-idle selection and the SimpleDRM workaround |
| Power and temperature monitoring | A temperature CLI and the pinned [RTX Spark `spark_hwmon` driver](https://github.com/johannhartmann/spark_hwmon/tree/rtx-spark), with 15 power readings, eight temperatures and four reduction-only power-limit controls on the validated firmware |
| CUDA | Toolkit installation, an `sm_121` GPU verification program and NVIDIA container setup instructions |
| Installation and recovery | Checked source inputs, a separate kernel/UKI, configuration and EFI backups, Limine hash verification and rollback tools |

The kernel recipe and P16 patches are included here. The `spark_hwmon` source,
installer and tests are fetched at an immutable commit by
`scripts/prepare-spark-hwmon.sh`; `sources.json` records the upstream source pins.
ACPI overrides are generated from the target machine's own firmware tables.

For the installed machine's package-owned customization and boot-image update
policy, see [Update-safe P16 installation](docs/update-safe.md).

## Supported hardware and software

| Component | Validated target |
|---|---|
| Laptop | **ASUS ProArt P16 H7607BA** |
| Platform / GPU | **NVIDIA RTX Spark N1X**, AArch64, GPU `10de:2e03`, CUDA compute capability **12.1** |
| Firmware | BIOS **H7607BA.300**, EC **2.16** |
| Base installation | Official **Omarchy ARM64 Nightly** |
| Patched kernel | Omarchy recipe **7.2.8-23**, producing **7.2.8-23-omarchy-p16-asus** |
| Validated NVIDIA driver | **615.78.08**, open kernel modules |

The install scripts check the laptop model and BIOS. The ACPI builder checks
firmware-table hashes; the expanded `spark_hwmon` register backend has its own
model/BIOS checks. Other ProArt P16 variants, RTX Spark machines and firmware
versions require separate validation.

A newer Nightly may ship a newer stock kernel. This guide installs the pinned
P16 kernel alongside it and preserves the existing boot entries. Apply these
patches only to the pinned source; see [boot recovery and updates](#9-boot-recovery-and-updates)
for upgrades.

## Scope and remaining limitations

This is a hardware enablement and installation repository. Application choices,
desktop appearance and Python/model-training environments are configured
separately. Factory fan curves remain active; custom ASUS fan control is not
provided. Some sensor functions and suspend/hibernate scenarios still require
testing. Energy calibration, PROCHOT polarity and some `spark_hwmon` diagnostic
fields remain unresolved and are exposed only as raw data. See
[hardware and limitations](#hardware-and-limitations) for the remaining checks.

## Installation

## 1. Install the ARM64 Nightly

Clone this repository on the machine used to prepare the installation USB drive:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johannhartmann/asus-proart-p16-rtx-spark-linux.git
cd asus-proart-p16-rtx-spark-linux
```

You need a USB drive of at least 8 GB, a USB keyboard for initial setup, AC power and internet access. Disable Secure Boot in UEFI. Selecting a full-disk installation erases the selected drive.

Download and verify the current ARM64 Nightly:

```bash
python3 scripts/download-nightly.py
```

The script reads the [ARM64 Nightly manifest](https://nightly.omarchy.org/edge-aarch64/latest.json), checks the architecture, file size and SHA-256, and saves the ISO and manifest under `build/iso/`. The separate `edge/latest.json` points to the x86_64 image.

Write the ISO to the USB drive using an image writer. Select the drive in the UEFI boot menu and install Omarchy. Choose your keyboard layout in the installer. The P16 kernel command line needs these parameters:

```text
console=tty0 acpi=nospcr acpi_osi="!Windows 2022"
```

`console=tty0 acpi=nospcr` is part of Omarchy's N1X configuration. On this BIOS, `acpi_osi="!Windows 2022"` enables SSPM/I²C enumeration needed by the internal keyboard and touchpad. Use the USB keyboard if internal input is unavailable in the installer. Step 5 embeds the required parameters in the P16 kernel's boot image.

After installation, boot the installed system into the regular Omarchy session. Make this repository available on that system and run the remaining commands from its root directory. Use `sudo` where shown.

## 2. Install build tools and platform packages

```bash
omarchy pkg add base-devel bc cpio gettext libelf pahole python git gnupg clang llvm lld rust rust-bindgen rust-src xxhash zstd
omarchy pkg add nvidia-open-dkms nvidia-utils python-gobject
```

The Nightly configures the N1X platform, NVIDIA graphics, encrypted boot and Limine. Use the NVIDIA packages from Omarchy's AArch64 repositories.

Install Omarchy's NVIDIA-aware power profile daemon:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed omarchy-power-profiles-daemon
sudo systemctl enable power-profiles-daemon.service
```

Confirm replacement of `power-profiles-daemon` if Pacman prompts for it. The Omarchy package provides the same service and `powerprofilesctl` command.

## 3. Generate the ACPI overrides

The [ACPI builder and battery-method transformations](https://github.com/pfeifferj/archlinuxarm-proart-p16/tree/3484cc008a9ee00b34c086c729e28e935cbc3430/01-platform/acpi/payload/provenance/hardware)
come from Josephine Pfeiffer's repository. Their source is retained unchanged;
this repository adds the Omarchy build/install wrappers and kernel-specific
initramfs integration. See [the retained MIT license](acpi/LICENSE).

Dump the original firmware tables while running the stock Nightly kernel, **before booting a kernel with ACPI overrides**:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/dump-acpi.sh
python3 scripts/build-acpi.py
```

The build uses the included ACPICA **20260408** source and checks the original tables and both generated overrides against pinned SHA-256 hashes. It rejects other firmware tables and tables that have already been patched. The dump script creates the parent `build/` directory with ownership assigned to the user who will compile the sources. It refuses to overwrite an existing `build/firmware/` directory.

Outputs:

```text
build/acpi/kernel/firmware/acpi/DSDT.aml
build/acpi/kernel/firmware/acpi/SSDT.aml
build/acpi/manifest.json
```

The DSDT corrects SSPM enumeration; the SSDT corrects EC and battery methods. The kernel includes the ARM64 allocation fix required for these overrides. Load the tables through the included initramfs hook for the P16 kernel. This does not flash the BIOS.

## 4. Build the P16 kernel

Run as your regular user:

```bash
./scripts/build-kernel.sh
```

The first run downloads the Linux source. Signature verification remains enabled, using an isolated GPG directory under `build/gnupg/`. Allow several tens of GB of free disk space. The build produces:

```text
kernel/linux-p16-asus-23-7.2.8-23-aarch64.pkg.tar.zst
kernel/linux-p16-asus-23-headers-7.2.8-23-aarch64.pkg.tar.zst
```

NVIDIA-DKMS requires the headers package. Pacman owns the installed kernel and modules; the installed headers allow DKMS builds after the source build directory has been removed.

`kernel/PKGBUILD` specifies the patch order and SHA-256/BLAKE2 checksums. Omarchy already includes the SPI-HID transport series; the remaining P16 patches add the ACPI IRQ retry, virtual GPIOs, thermal filtering and ACPI allocation fix. The combined ASUS patch already includes ARM64 WMI support, relocation to `drivers/platform/asus/` and the P16 RSOC fix. Apply it once as part of the recipe.

## 5. Install the kernel and system configuration

First prepare the P16 speaker firmware as your regular user:

```bash
python3 scripts/peripherals.py prepare
python3 scripts/peripherals.py check-inputs
```

This downloads the pinned ASUS audio driver archive and uses `bsdtar` (provided
by Arch's `libarchive` package) to extract three CS35L56 firmware/tuning files.
The Windows executable is never run. Archive size, SHA-256, embedded archive
offset, member paths and output hashes are fixed in
`config/speaker-firmware.json`. Downloads and extracted firmware stay under
`build/speaker-firmware/`; no OEM firmware is redistributed in this repository.
Preparation needs internet on the first run; a verified cached archive works
offline. A failed download or hash mismatch stops installation before live writes.

The ASUS download URL, archive offset, member paths, sizes and SHA-256 values
come unchanged from Pfeiffer's
[hardware lock](https://github.com/pfeifferj/archlinuxarm-proart-p16/blob/3484cc008a9ee00b34c086c729e28e935cbc3430/07-build/media/payload/locks/hardware.json).
Her [speaker-tuning installer](https://github.com/pfeifferj/archlinuxarm-proart-p16/blob/3484cc008a9ee00b34c086c729e28e935cbc3430/06-installation/archinstall/payload/src/h7607a/archinstall_adapter.py)
documents the same extraction workflow. The firmware itself is ASUS/Cirrus
material. Our [peripheral helper](scripts/peripherals.py) implements this
workflow for the existing Omarchy installation transaction.

The installer appends the P16 PixArt `093a:4f01` pressure workaround to
`/etc/libinput/local-overrides.quirks`, preserving other device settings and
leaving an identical existing P16 entry unchanged. A conflicting P16 entry
requires reconciliation rather than silently adding another policy. The three
firmware files and an explicit mkinitcpio `FILES` drop-in are installed before
building the new UKI, so early audio probing can also find the tuning. Different existing
firmware is not overwritten. Both the quirks file and firmware destinations
are covered by the same backup/rollback as the kernel installation.

The pressure settings match Pfeiffer's
[P16 libinput quirk](https://github.com/pfeifferj/archlinuxarm-proart-p16/blob/3484cc008a9ee00b34c086c729e28e935cbc3430/03-system/input-audio/payload/runtime/usr/share/libinput/60-h7607a-touchpad.quirks):
`AttrPressureRange=none` and `AttrPalmPressureThreshold=0`. Our
[quirk file](config/p16-touchpad.quirks) retains the existing local section name
and DMI match pattern. The local additions are duplicate/conflict detection,
preservation of other quirks, explicit initramfs firmware inclusion and coverage
by the installer's backup/restore mechanism.

These files target the observed `spkid0` speaker configuration on H7607BA.300.
The existing Omarchy audio machine driver and UCM provide routing; this step
does not replace UCM, mixer settings or microphone policy. Other speaker IDs
need separate qualification. On an already configured machine, check the
installed files without reinstalling the kernel:

```bash
python3 scripts/peripherals.py check-installed
```

This checks file contents, not touchpad gestures or audible speaker output.

The new package is named `linux-p16-asus-23` so an existing `linux-p16-asus` package and its `7.2.8-14-omarchy-p16-asus` kernel stay installed. Keep the old kernel and boot entry until the new kernel has booted successfully. The ACPI hook and ASUS services continue to support that older P16 kernel.

From the installed Omarchy system:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/install-kernel.sh
```

The installer:

- checks the architecture, model, BIOS, mounted EFI partition and ACPI files;
- backs up affected configuration files and complete existing EFI images, with checksums, under `/root/p16-install.XXXXXXXX/`;
- installs the kernel and headers, builds NVIDIA-DKMS and generates module dependencies;
- installs early input drivers, the kernel-specific ACPI hook and ASUS services;
- installs the P16 touchpad pressure quirk and verified speaker firmware;
- preserves the target machine's root/LUKS parameters and adds the validated P16 boot parameters;
- installs NVIDIA DRM modesetting/fbdev configuration and blocks the conflicting legacy `nvidiafb` driver;
- builds an additional unified kernel image (UKI) and verifies its kernel, ACPI tables and required modules;
- registers `linux-p16-asus-23` with Limine and verifies EFI BLAKE2b hashes;
- displays the boot menu for ten seconds while preserving the existing default entry.

The generated P16 UKI explicitly includes `power_wrap_drv.usb4_release=0`,
`pci=hpbussize=0x80,hpmmiosize=32M,hpmmioprefsize=32G`,
`mem_sleep_default=s2idle` and
`initcall_blacklist=simpledrm_platform_driver_init`, in addition to the console
and ACPI options above. These retain USB4 resources, reserve PCI hotplug space,
select suspend-to-idle and avoid the conflicting SimpleDRM initialization.
The corresponding Limine drop-ins preserve these options during later UKI
rebuilds. They apply to the normal default command line; keep Omarchy's separate
fallback command line for recovery. Existing `pci=` settings are replaced with
the validated P16 values; unrelated initcall blacklist entries are preserved.

NVIDIA `modeset=1` and `fbdev=1` are installed before the new initramfs is built.
Use the packaged Omarchy Hyprland NVIDIA defaults for the graphics environment.
With the validated NVIDIA 615.78.08 open driver, the packaged
`NVreg_UseKernelSuspendNotifiers=1` configuration handles suspend; do not add the
legacy NVIDIA suspend services alongside it. This is configuration coverage,
not a claim that every suspend or hibernation scenario has been tested.

Existing EFI images are preserved. The root filesystem needs enough space for their complete backup, in addition to the kernel build space. The installer locks the boot partition against concurrent Limine writes.

On an error or Ctrl+C, the installer restores the backed-up boot files and system configuration. Installed kernel/header packages remain in place. After resolving the error, resume using the same package files:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/install-kernel.sh --resume /root/p16-install.XXXXXXXX
```

Replace `XXXXXXXX` with the actual backup suffix printed when installation started. Resume validates the root-owned checkpoint, all backup files and both package checksums. It restores the original boot files before repeating installation. This also supports recovery from an interruption that prevented automatic restoration. A successfully completed installation cannot be resumed. Checkpoints created before the NVIDIA/platform or peripheral configuration additions can still be restored, but must be resumed using their original installer revision. A manually restored checkpoint can be resumed with the same package files while the boot environment still matches.

Reboot and select **`linux-p16-asus-23`** in the Limine menu. Then check:

```bash
uname -r
./scripts/check-system.sh
sudo python3 scripts/verify-boot.py
```

`uname -r` must report `7.2.8-23-omarchy-p16-asus`. Battery readings should be plausible, `nvidia-smi` should list the GPU, and the three services should have started successfully. `powerprofilesctl list` should report `nvidia_rtx_spark` and `platform_profile` as drivers.

## 6. Configure a German keyboard layout

For a German layout, run these commands as your regular user in the graphical session:

```bash
python3 scripts/set-german-keyboard.py
sudo localectl --no-convert set-keymap de
sudo limine-mkinitcpio
sudo python3 scripts/verify-boot.py
```

The script sets the desktop and Fcitx to `de` using Omarchy's installed keyboard configuration logic, then reloads Hyprland. `localectl` sets the console keymap; rebuilding the UKIs embeds it for the LUKS prompt on the next boot. The `hid_asus` driver is included in the initramfs for internal keyboard input.

## 7. ASUS profiles, battery and temperatures

Select a power profile:

```bash
powerprofilesctl set balanced
powerprofilesctl set performance
powerprofilesctl set power-saver
```

Balanced maps to ASUS Balanced, Performance to ASUS Performance, and Power Saver to ASUS Quiet. The daemon also controls the NVIDIA CPU backend.

`p16-asus-controls.service` loads the ASUS driver before power profile discovery. `p16-charge-limit.service` sets the charge limit to **100%** after battery registration. Both services are restricted to the validated ASUS P16 kernel releases (`7.2.8-14` and `7.2.8-23`). The factory fan curves remain active.

Display temperatures:

```bash
p16-temperatures
p16-temperatures --watch
p16-temperatures --json
```

The monitor reads ACPI, NVIDIA, NVMe, Wi-Fi and fan interfaces. The kernel excludes PSYS/PSOC power telemetry from thermal zone registration. Eight firmware zones have invalid `_CRT` limits (`0x7fffffff`); their temperature readings work, but no replacement thresholds are introduced. THRM's existing 100 °C passive and 103 °C critical limits are preserved.

### RTX Spark power and temperature telemetry

After rebooting successfully into `7.2.8-23-omarchy-p16-asus`, install the
validated `spark_hwmon` backend. Its complete source and tests are fetched from
the immutable commit in `sources.json`, version **0.3.0.rtxspark.5**:

```bash
omarchy pkg add dkms
./scripts/prepare-spark-hwmon.sh
sudo ./build/spark_hwmon/scripts/install-dkms.sh
cat /sys/module/spbm/version
python3 build/spark_hwmon/tests/check-n1x.py --require-all --require-mmio
```

The installer requires headers for the running kernel, builds before replacing
the module, and restores the previous DKMS version if replacement fails. Its
ACPI aliases load `spbm` automatically on subsequent boots; no extra service is
needed. DKMS rebuilds it for future kernels with installed headers. This module
is installed separately from the kernel transaction; the kernel restore command
does not uninstall it.

On this model and BIOS it exposes 15 power readings, eight temperatures, four
reduction-only power-limit controls and raw status/energy/diagnostic words under
`/sys/class/hwmon/` (`name=spbm_n1x`). Installation does not change power limits.
Absolute energy calibration, PROCHOT polarity and some diagnostic meanings remain
unresolved; raw values must not be presented as calibrated energy or alarms.
See the fetched driver's README and validation reports before using controls.

## 8. CUDA and GPU containers

```bash
omarchy pkg add cuda
source /etc/profile
nvcc --version
./scripts/check-cuda.sh
```

The toolkit is installed under `/opt/cuda`. The test compiles for **`sm_121`** and verifies all 4096 results of a GPU vector addition. Success produces `"result":"passed"`. NVIDIA-SMI reports the driver's CUDA capability; `nvcc --version` reports the installed toolkit version. Prebuilt PyTorch wheels also have their own CUDA runtime version.

To enable GPU access in Docker:

```bash
omarchy install docker
omarchy pkg add nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker --set-as-default
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Start GPU containers with `docker run --gpus all ...`. Restarting Docker interrupts running containers. Python training environments and Kubernetes are separate from this hardware setup.

## 9. Boot recovery and updates

On this P16, the RTX Spark NPU kernel is also allowed by the P16 ACPI
initramfs hook and ASUS control services. `scripts/install-npu-policy.sh`
installs those narrowly scoped host integrations; it does not build or replace
an NPU kernel. The read-only `scripts/check-update-state.py` checks installed P16 config,
touchpad and speaker firmware after an Omarchy update. The user-owned
`post-update` hook runs it automatically.

The separate `zz-p16-boot-menu.hook` runs after package-driven Limine rebuilds.
It verifies every hashed EFI image and restores the validated ten-second P16
menu timeout. The Mayflower Plymouth logo is maintained by its own package
hook and root-owned source under `/etc/mayflower-boot/`. Neither hook claims
that a future kernel automatically supports the NPU; that requires a new
kernel build and physical qualification.

If the P16 kernel fails to boot, select the existing `linux-omarchy` entry in Limine. Use `linux-omarchy-fallback` if the display stays black. Press `Esc` to reveal a hidden boot menu. The stock kernel does not activate the P16 ACPI overrides or the two P16 services.

To restore the original configuration, boot the stock kernel and run:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/restore-install.sh /root/p16-install.XXXXXXXX
```

Use the actual backup suffix. The script validates all backups and compares the stock kernel images and installed Linux/NVIDIA package versions against the checkpoint before writing any files. Changed versions or missing compatibility metadata cause restoration to stop without changing the current boot files. For a matching environment, it restores the EFI images, matching Limine configuration, system files (including the original console keymap) and previous service enablement link. It removes newly created P16 boot files while leaving kernel/header packages installed. To install again after restoration, use `install-kernel.sh --resume` with that same checkpoint and unchanged package files.

For a BLAKE2b mismatch, restore the EFI image and its matching menu entry together. Do not modify an EFI image after registering its hash. Inspect PE sections with read-only tools. `scripts/verify-boot.py` does not modify images and rejects missing P16 entries as well as missing, malformed or incorrect hashes.

After an NVIDIA package update, ensure DKMS builds successfully for the P16 kernel:

```bash
dkms status
sudo dkms autoinstall -k 7.2.8-23-omarchy-p16-asus
sudo depmod -a 7.2.8-23-omarchy-p16-asus
```

Then rebuild the UKI through Omarchy's `limine-mkinitcpio` workflow and run `sudo python3 scripts/verify-boot.py` so the initramfs and root filesystem contain matching drivers. Preserve the stock kernel and its fallback entry when changing kernels.

After a BIOS update, do not boot the P16 kernel with the old ACPI overrides. Boot the stock kernel and use the restore command to remove the P16 setup. Restoration checks the model but allows a changed BIOS; installation continues to require H7607BA.300. If stock kernels or NVIDIA packages were also updated, the old backup cannot safely restore their boot files: keep the current stock images and repair from the stock kernel instead of copying old EFI files back. Supporting a different kernel release requires updating and checking the patches, mkinitcpio hook, drop-in and service `ConditionKernelVersion` settings together.

## Hardware and limitations

| Hardware | Identity |
|---|---|
| GPU | NVIDIA `10de:2e03`, subsystem `1043:1484`, compute capability 12.1 |
| Internal keyboard | HID `0b05:4b42`, ACPI `MKB0001`, `hid_asus` |
| Touchpad | HID `093a:4f01`, `hid-multitouch` |
| SPI sensor hub | `MSFW1111` / `PNP0C51`, virtual GPIO/IRQ 190, `spi_hid_acpi` |
| ASUS WMI | Management `97845ED0-4E6D-11DE-8A39-0800200C9A66`, event `0B3CBB35-E3C2-45ED-91C2-4C5A6D195D1C` |

SPI-HID provides the sensor hub transport. Complete sensor measurements, physical charge cutoff, fan response, suspend/resume, NVENC/NVDEC and thermal shutdown require separate testing. ASUS Armoury and custom fan curves are not enabled. Some optional NVML power and memory metrics may be unavailable on N1X.

### NVIDIA DRM mapping review (2026-10-25)

Josephine Pfeiffer's [Normal-NC candidate patch](https://github.com/pfeifferj/archlinuxarm-proart-p16/blob/3484cc008a9ee00b34c086c729e28e935cbc3430/02-drivers/nvidia-display/patches/provenance/hardware/drm.patch)
applies without offsets or fuzz to the installed `nvidia-open-dkms 615.78.08-3`
source. On ARM64 it changes uncached RAM-backed GEM `vmap` mappings from
Device-nGnRnE to Normal-NC and adds a write barrier before PRIME unmapping.
The two affected callers map RAM pages; cached user-memory mappings and the
non-RAM `ioremap_wc` path retain their existing memory types. Normal-NC matches
the DRM core's write-combined userspace mapping. This is a plausible mapping
correction, not evidence of a measured performance gain or an observed crash.

An isolated build against `7.2.8-23-omarchy-p16-asus` succeeded. The candidate
`nvidia-drm.ko` imports the same 280 versioned symbols as the installed module,
with identical CRCs. Compiler warnings were in unchanged driver files. This
establishes source/build compatibility only. The patch affects ARM64 generally,
not just this laptop, and remains outside the default installation pending
physical display/PRIME and suspend/resume qualification. No installed driver,
loaded module or boot image was changed during this review.

## Provenance and local additions

References to Pfeiffer's work below are pinned to commit
[`3484cc008a9ee00b34c086c729e28e935cbc3430`](https://github.com/pfeifferj/archlinuxarm-proart-p16/tree/3484cc008a9ee00b34c086c729e28e935cbc3430).
They identify the inputs used here, independently of later upstream changes.

| Component | Source and treatment in this repository |
|---|---|
| ACPI builder and battery transformations | [Pfeiffer's ACPI sources](https://github.com/pfeifferj/archlinuxarm-proart-p16/tree/3484cc008a9ee00b34c086c729e28e935cbc3430/01-platform/acpi/payload/provenance/hardware): `acpi_builder.py`, `power-method-changes.json`, `power-source.sed` and `power-splice.json` are byte-identical copies under `acpi/`. Our scripts wrap them for local firmware dumps, builds and Omarchy installation. |
| ARM64 ACPI allocation fix | [Source patch](https://github.com/pfeifferj/archlinuxarm-proart-p16/blob/3484cc008a9ee00b34c086c729e28e935cbc3430/01-platform/kernel/patches/provenance/hardware/backports/acpi/0001-arm64-bound-acpi-override-allocation.patch): copied unchanged as [kernel/arm64-acpi-allocation.patch](kernel/arm64-acpi-allocation.patch), integrated into the Omarchy kernel recipe. |
| Touchpad pressure workaround | [Source quirk](https://github.com/pfeifferj/archlinuxarm-proart-p16/blob/3484cc008a9ee00b34c086c729e28e935cbc3430/03-system/input-audio/payload/runtime/usr/share/libinput/60-h7607a-touchpad.quirks): same device IDs and pressure settings; local section name/DMI pattern and installation into `/etc/libinput/local-overrides.quirks` instead of a packaged `/usr/share/libinput/` file. |
| Speaker firmware | [Source lock](https://github.com/pfeifferj/archlinuxarm-proart-p16/blob/3484cc008a9ee00b34c086c729e28e935cbc3430/07-build/media/payload/locks/hardware.json): extraction metadata for the three `spkid0` files is retained in [config/speaker-firmware.json](config/speaker-firmware.json). Firmware is downloaded from ASUS and extracted locally; no firmware binaries are redistributed. |
| NVIDIA DRM Normal-NC patch | [Source patch](https://github.com/pfeifferj/archlinuxarm-proart-p16/blob/3484cc008a9ee00b34c086c729e28e935cbc3430/02-drivers/nvidia-display/patches/provenance/hardware/drm.patch): reviewed and built unchanged in an isolated local tree. It is **not included in the installed driver or enabled by this installer**. |

The peripheral integration added here on **2026-10-25** consists of
[scripts/peripherals.py](scripts/peripherals.py), the local configuration and
firmware manifest, installer/checkpoint integration and
[regression tests](tests/test_peripherals.py). The actual ASUS download and
extraction were verified against all three pinned hashes, and the installed
files matched. The boot log also showed both amplifiers loading these files
and applying calibration. The full 44-test suite passed normally and with
Python assertions disabled. This did not include a fresh OS installation,
an audible playback test or a physical test of the DRM candidate.

The surrounding kernel recipe and many device patches come from Omarchy and
their credited upstream authors. Our P16-specific additions and integration

Limine installation/recovery, and the separately pinned `spark_hwmon` N1X
backend. Original source notices are retained; see [sources.json](sources.json)

The large `kernel/` file count comes from the pinned Omarchy recipe: its local
source inputs include patches, detached signatures and the ARM64 configuration.
Every bundled patch/signature is referenced by `PKGBUILD`; the three public
keys verify upstream signatures. The inherited recipe also carries patches for
other architectures. They are retained to reproduce the validated kernel base,
rather than selectively changing it for this laptop. Local kernel source trees,
packages and other build outputs are ignored by Git. Generated `.SRCINFO`
metadata is not stored; it can be recreated with `makepkg --printsrcinfo`.

Verify repository checksums with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`. See [LICENSES.md](LICENSES.md) for licensing.

## Check the scripts

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The tests use temporary filesystems to check invalid boot entries, complete EFI backups, interrupted installation recovery, boot-version mismatches, restored-checkpoint reuse, corrupted backups and operation with Python assertions disabled. Peripheral tests cover existing touchpad settings, conflicting policies, corrupted firmware, repeat installation and rollback. Runtime validation remains active under Python optimization. The tests do not install a kernel or change the running system configuration.
